Vietnam National High School Exam 2018 – Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the Vietnam National High School Exam dataset from 2018, which contains scores from over one million candidates. The purpose of the analysis is to clean and organize the dataset, describe the overall score distribution, explore statistical characteristics of each subject, visualize patterns, study correlations between subjects, and compute composite scores for common university admission blocks. The project concludes with several observations that summarize the behavior and tendencies found within the data.

The analysis consists of several major components:

– Data cleaning and standardization, including merging multiple sheets, converting data types, extracting province codes from candidate IDs, and handling missing values.
– Descriptive statistics for each subject, including the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and distribution characteristics.
– Score-level analysis such as the proportion of students scoring below 1, above 5, above 8, or above 9.
– Distribution exploration through histograms, boxplots, and density plots to visualize differences between subjects.
– Provincial-level analysis comparing average scores across provinces and regions to identify performance patterns.
– Correlation analysis across natural sciences and social sciences subjects to understand how test performance relates across disciplines.
– Calculation of admission block scores, including A00, A01, C00, and D01, followed by exploratory evaluation of their distributions.

The project includes two main files:

– exam_scores_2018_analysis.py: Python script containing all data cleaning and analysis procedures.
– vietnam_exam_scores_2018_full_report.pdf: A complete report summarizing the analysis, including visualizations, descriptive tables, and key insights.

The analysis was conducted using Python, primarily with the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries, along with Jupyter Notebook for exploratory development.

This project was created by hide0nheartt as part of a data analysis learning and portfolio-building effort.
